# Diana
Diana is a python game bot. She's not completely finished and there are many issues yet to be resolved. Besides those issues, there are quite a number of limitations in using her, and she will take control of your PC while active. 

She's originally designed to be used under one OS (Windows) with one screen resolution (1920x1080) and a limited set of available ATs. Majority of stuff was brutally hardcoded to fit given resolution and a specific game version, so Diana is extremely vulnerable for any game UI update. Although with a great deal of work she probably could be adapted for 'public' use, meaning wider resolution adaptation, every game UI update will require a lot of efforts to make her work again.

# What she can
- Move assault groups around the global map
- Retreat groups to rear if they need rest and\or reinforcements
- Reinforce groups once they've reached a safe town and let them rest 
- Redeploy assault groups if they were destroyed
