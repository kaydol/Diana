# Octavia
Octavia is a python global map bot for \ H3r 0e5 & 63n eral5 /. She's not finished, there are many issues that need to be resolved. Besides those issues, there are quite a number of limitations in using her, and she will take control of your PC while active. 

Although with a great deal of work she probably could be adapted for 'public' use, she's originally designed to be used on only one specific PC with one specific screen resolution and a limited set of available ATs. Majority of stuff was brutally hardcoded to fit a specific machine with a specific game version, and she's extremely vulnerable for any game UI update.

Once finished, Octavia will be an AI commander playing her role on the global map, moving assault teams around, smart enough to retreat & reinforce them when needed, as well as to deploy them in the city nearest to the frontline.
